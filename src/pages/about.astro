		passion lies in the subtleties of guiding and nurturing the growth of AI
		understanding and implementation. With a background rich in technology
		leadership, my recent endeavors have centered around demystifying the
		complexities of generative AI for enterprises. Over the past year and a
		half, my focus has shifted to supporting and advising enterprises in
		their adoption of Azure OpenAI Service and Generative AI, guiding them
		through the nuances of these powerful technologies to drive innovation
		and growth.
